Sep. 19 meeting:

Some tools:

[RDF Translator](http://rdf-translator.appspot.com/) Note: this only seems to work correctly with JSON-LD that is in "expanded" form, not "compacted" form. Convert to expanded form at JSON-LD Playground before convertint to other serializations.

[JSON-LD Playground](http://json-ld.org/playground/) Validates JSON-LD and converts from one form to another.  Also includes some examples.

[LODLive for graph visualization](http://en.lodlive.it/)

[W3C RDF validator; generates a graphical display, but only accepts RDF/XML as an input (convert using RDF Translator, then paste in)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/)

Things to investigate:

[International Image Interoperability Framework] (http://iiif.io/)

[Mirador] (http://projectmirador.org)
