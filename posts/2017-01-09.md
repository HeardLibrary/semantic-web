# Week 1 in Review

Welcome back to the Semantic Web Working Group! We reconvened on January 9, 2017 after a brief break for the holidays and have an exciting semester of linked data projects planned.

In Fall 2016, we integrated review of abstract ideas in [Linked Data: Structured Data on the Web](https://www.manning.com/books/linked-data) with the concrete task of making [Tracy Miller's Chinese Temples](http://heardlibrary.github.io/semantic-web/tang-song.html) dataset more accessible and easily searchable. The success of the previous semester has led us to restructure our meetings for Spring 2017.

Our overarching goals remain the same: to understand what the semantic web is, to identify ways to fruitfully contribute to it, and to explore new resources and directions for using linked data in our work, research, and teaching. In addition, we seek to accomplish the following in Spring 2017:
* Define and explore the advantages of, and barriers to, adding datasets to the semantic web
* Practice going from soup (CSV) to nuts (RDF) with multiple datasets
* Demonstrate the wide-ranging applicability of Steve Baskauf's CSV-to-RDF template
* Document our work to encourage and aid others in adding their data to the semantic web

To gain more hands-on experience in creating linked open data, we will spend the first part of the semester working with a single dataset. Subsequently, we will explore other options for contributing to the semantic web (topics still TBD). Whether or not you can join us in person this semester, we encourage you to follow along in the weekly meeting notes and contact us with any questions or comments.

## New Cultural Heritage Dataset: Music and Vase-Painting

The SWWG Spring 2017 dataset derives from the dissertation research of Veronica Ikeshoji-Orlati, CLIR postdoctoral fellow for data curation in the Vanderbilt Libraries. Collected during a 2014 research trip to the [A.D. Trendall Research Centre for Ancient Mediterranean Studies at La Trobe University](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/trendall) (Melbourne, VIC, Australia), the dataset describes 1,652 vases produced in the region of Apulia (in Southern Italy) around the 4th century BCE. In particular, it documents the representations of music - instruments, performers, and performance contexts - on red-figure vases with figural decoration.

The dataset is the germ of a research project which investigates how performative and visual cultures intertwined during the late 5th and 4th centuries BCE in South Italy and Sicily. As will be seen below, one of the reasons to make the dataset available on the semantic web is to connect it to other datasets about related topics, such as ancient Greek music, archaeological excavations in South Italy and Sicily, museum collection information, et cetera.

The dataset is currently stored in a single CSV file. Each line of the CSV describes a single vase, and the shareable data collected are listed and described below. Additional data types (such as the prose descriptions of the decoration on the vessels and the file names for images which were taken for research but for which publication permissions have not been clarified) have been omitted.

VARIABLE							| Description
:---								| :---
MEDIUM 								| The material from which the object is made
FABRIC 								| The region of production (applicable during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE)
TECHNIQUE 							| The decorative or production technique
FORM 								| The shape of the object
SUB-FORM 							| The specifier for the shape of the object
START_DATE 							| The estimated terminus post quem the object was made
END_DATE							| The estimated terminus ante quem the object was made
PAINTER								| The attributed or signed decorator of the vase (if known)
POTTER								| The attributed or signed creator of the vase (if known)
PROVENIENCE							| The location where the object was excavated (if known)
LOCATION_COUNTRY					| The current country in which the object is located (if known)
LOCATION_CITY						| The current city in which the object is located (if known)
COLLECTION_NAME						| The name of the current collection (museum, private, or other, if known) in which the object is located
COLLECTION_ID						| The unique identifier of the object within the current collection
TRENDALL_PUB						| The abbreviated name of the volume in which A.D. Trendall published the vase (applicable only to red-figure vases of South Italy and Sicily)
TRENDALL_ID 						| The unique identifier given to red-figure vases of South Italy and Sicily by A.D. Trendall

For the following datatypes, the * should be replaced with 'A' or 'B'. 'A' and 'B' refer to the sides of a vase, as identified by A.D. Trendall.

VARIABLE							| Description
:---								| :---
SCENE_TYPE_*						| From an internally-controlled list, an abbreviated description of the scene type(s)
MUSICAL_SCENE_TYPE_*				| From an internally-controlled list, an abbreviated description of the scene type(s) with an abbreviated notation of the musical instruments depicted
SIDE_*_INSTRUMENTS_AND_NUMBERS		| From an internally-controlled list, an abbreviated designator of the type and number of musical instruments depicted
SIDE_*_PERFORMERS					| From an internally-controlled list, an abbreviated designator of the figure associated with the musical instrument(s)
SIDE_*_PERFORMER_LOCATION			| Based on a 3x3 grid laid over the decorated portion of the side of the vase, an abbreviated indication of the approximate location of the figure associated with the musical instrument(s)
SIDE_*_PERFORMER_ACTION 			| From an internally-controlled list, an abbreviated designator of the actions, poses, or movement of the figure associated with the musical instrument(s)
SIDE_*_NUMBER_OF_FIGURES			| From an internally-controlled list, a count of the different types of figures depicted on the side of the vase
SIDE_*_COMPOSITION					| From an internally-controlled list, a description of the layout of the decoration on the side of the vase

## Preliminary Dataset Considerations

A few observations and points of clarification may proof useful at this juncture.

The first group of variables listed above describe the object as a whole. Though many of the data types may apply to objects of different media and time periods, the bias towards describing a specific type of object (namely, figure-decorated vases) is evident in the identification of the two creator types ('Painter' and 'Potter'), the use of the term 'Fabric' to describe the region of production, and the fields for Trendall publication name and ID (which encompasses exclusively red-figure vases produced in South Italy and Sicily during the late 5th and 4th centuries BCE).

In addition, some of the values collected in the general object description part of the dataset are intrinsic properties (such as the medium and technique), whereas others describe mutable aspects (such as the collection information). When preparing a contribution to the semantic web, the utility of recording mutable qualities may change how the data are modelled and converted into RDF. In the case of the current dataset, for example, the collection ID (which may change based on the sale or transfer of an object from one collection to another) is a less stable identifier than the Trendall ID (which generally is assigned only once). The collection information is still included, however, since it opens pathways to connect to institutional datasets about the objects.

The second group of data types (denoted by the asterisk (\*)) describe the decoration of one side or the other of the vase. The decoration may have none, one, or multiple scene types, as well as none, one, or multiple musical scene types. (To be included in the dataset, however, at least one side has to have at least one musical scene type.) While all of the descriptive data and abbreviations are internally consistent, they do not directly correlate to any recognized authority, thereby requiring further attention in the process of adding the dataset to the semantic web.

A less obvious flaw in the second part of the dataset rests in the correlation between scene type, musical scene type, and performer location. Specifically, it should be noted that the various locations of scene and musical scene types on the decorated surfaces of the vases have not been identified in the dataset, and on sides with complicated, multi-scene decoration, it is only through a circuitous path that the organization of the figural decoration can be reconstructed.

## Modelling the Dataset

CSVs and other tabular forms of representing data do not define the relationships between each datatype recorded. Data modelling, therefore, is the first step in translating data from a tabular to graphical or relational form. Thoughtful and comprehensive data modelling is critical to preparing data for conversion into RDF, since the semantic web is fundamentally built on the relationships between data points. In RDF terms, the goal of data modelling can be described as expressing the entire dataset in the form of triples (subject-predicate-object).

In our first meeting of the semester, we briefly examined the dataset and then broke out into three groups to brainstorm some preliminary models of the data. Using whiteboards, each group sketched out the relationships between the data, and three distinct graphs were created:

Data Model 1

Data Model 2

Data Model 3

In comparing the three graphs, a couple of intriguing commonalities come to the fore. Every group, for example, placed the vase at the center of their graph. If the CSV were to be translated directly into RDF, however, there is no column (or node) for the vase itself. How is the object, then, added to the semantic web? Is it represented as a blank node characterized by the intersection of a bunch of attributes? Should a unique identifier stand in for the object itself? Or is there a better way to represent a physical thing in the digital world?

All three groups also encountered difficulty in defining the relationship between sides of the vases, scenes on the scenes, and the iconographic features recorded in the dataset. Take a look at graphs 1 and 3, in particular, and consider how they deal with organizing the data points gathered about the decoration of the objects.

A few major differences arose as well. Group 1, for example, delved into the connection of the objects to collections, thinking forward to how to match the objects in our dataset to those described in linked open data by museums and collectors. Group 3 thought about the decoration of the vases and how to tie the iconographic elements in our dataset (instruments, mythological figures) to other art historical and archaeological datasets. Group 2, instead of thinking about linking the dataset out, focused on how each of the elements within the dataset related to one another.

## Concluding Remarks

As with many datasets which aim to make qualitative data quantifiable, the SWWG Spring 2017 dataset provides a partial and imperfect reflection of the things it seeks to describe based on the research questions its author sought to answer. The dataset thereby highlights a key value of the semantic web to archaeological and art historical research (and, by extension, to social science and humanities research as a whole): by making one partial dataset interoperable with other partial datasets, researchers can build on the work of others and perpetually contribute to an ever-growing descriptive framework for diverse types of research materials such as cultural heritage objects.

At our next meeting on January 23, we will investigate some of the authorities and lexica which can facilitate linking our dataset to the semantic web of archaeological artefacts and museum objects writ large.
